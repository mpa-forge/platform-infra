# Platform Git And Release Workflow

Use this skill when work touches git flow, release policy, or versioning decisions.

## Default Workflow

1. Work on a short-lived branch.
2. Merge into `main` only through a PR.
3. Keep `main` protected and never push to it directly.
4. Never create commits on local `main`; branch before the first commit.
5. Detect the repository's allowed merge methods before merging the PR.
6. Use an allowed merge method on `main`, preferring squash when the repo policy permits it.
7. Treat release tags as the production promotion boundary.

## Branch Policy

- Protected branch:
  - `main`
- Local working rule:
  - `main` must stay aligned with `origin/main`
  - create or switch to a short-lived branch before making the first commit
- Short-lived branches:
  - `feat/<short-description>`
  - `fix/<short-description>`
  - `chore/<short-description>`
  - `hotfix/<short-description>`

## PR Policy

- every change reaches `main` via PR
- PR must be human-reviewed and approved
- required checks must pass before merge
- do not merge the PR yourself unless the task explicitly requires merge handling

Baseline required checks:

- lint
- tests
- code quality gates
- security and secret scans
- contract checks where applicable

## Merge Strategy

- Do not assume every repo allows the same merge method.
- Determine the allowed merge strategy before attempting merge.
  - Prefer repository metadata or existing repo policy docs when available.
  - If policy is not documented locally, inspect the PR or repo settings through the available GitHub tooling before choosing a merge command.
- Prefer squash merge on `main` when the repository allows it.
- If squash merge is not allowed, use another allowed strategy instead of retrying blindly with the same command.

Use this to keep history clean, make rollback easier by PR unit, and avoid failed merge attempts caused by repo-specific restrictions.

## Versioning

- version independently per repository
- use SemVer: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- use plain git tags:
  - `vX.Y.Z`

SemVer meaning:

- `PATCH`:
  - fixes and internal changes with no contract break
- `MINOR`:
  - backward-compatible additive behavior
- `MAJOR`:
  - breaking behavior or contract changes

## Release Promotion

- merge to `main`:
  - auto-deploy to `rc`
- promote to `prod`:
  - create release tag `vX.Y.Z`
  - run prod promotion workflow with required approvals and smoke gates

## Hotfix Flow

- use `hotfix/*`
- still require PR, checks, and human approval
- release a new patch tag after merge

## Working Tree And Cleanup Rule

- leave the repository worktree clean when finished
- remove temporary files and generated scratch artifacts unless they are intended outputs
- do not leave abandoned local branches behind

After squash-merged work:

- switch to `main`
- pull latest `origin/main`
- delete the local feature branch if it still exists
- verify the worktree is clean

After any merged work:

- verify the PR is actually merged before cleaning up
- delete the remote branch when the hosting workflow allows it
- if local `main` was behind, fast-forward it before continuing more work

## Contract Compatibility Rule

For `platform-contracts`:

- require `buf lint`
- require `buf breaking`
- do not make breaking changes in place
- create a new major namespace/package version for breaking changes
- keep generated TypeScript package version aligned to the release tag

## Escalate to Planning Docs

Update platform planning docs or ADRs when the workflow or release policy itself changes, not just when you are following it.
